ABOUT FOLDER table-creation
---------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the SQL code written in Snowflake queries to create/replace the tables, establishing the unique keys, primary keys, foreign keys, data types
and their value length/size. The indication of columns that cannot be NULL (othewr than unique keys) are also established, and the constraints to connect the columns
with columns of other tables are also established.
